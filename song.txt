Yung Lean - Fallen Demon

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out
I feel sick into the ceiling, hurt to see my life
I go in for my set, shawty, get it wet
So many fires in my grave, feels like on a jet
So many engines, like my diamonds need a serviette
They didn't let me out for three weeks
Feel like a vet
I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out
I feel sick into the ceiling, hurt to see my life

[Verse 1]
Woodgrain drippin', finger lickin', polo'd down
Cider sippin', slide the coupe and switch it out
Stockholm city, dungeon with me
We doin' dirt, blowin' smoke
Countin' bands on the low
Smokin earth 'round the globe
With the team from the snow
Doin' dirt, blowin' smoke
Countin' bands on the low
Smokin' earth 'round the globe
With the team from the snow
Draped in fur like a bird
I got gold 'round my toes
Doin' dirt, Gucci skirt
Shawty down where i go
Woodgrain grippin, Henney sippin'
Vodka Red Bull, eatin' chicken
Say we wicked like the witches
I got love for all my *** (Lean)
And I got love for all my ***
